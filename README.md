## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

This is my first time trialling BEM methodology for naming my CSS classes. I found it useful to have a set of rules to follow for naming, though may investigate other systems in future projects to compare.
